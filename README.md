# PitchPal-Capstone-Project

This project is an application that helps in linking the football playersâ€™ community with sports centers owners. Briefly speaking, the website enables football players to form teams, view sports centers near them, invite each other to games, and reserve football fields. Moving to field owners, the application will enable them to add their fields to the system and manipulate (see and edit) the reservations. The players can review the fields they play in. They can also rate other players and teams.

This project will include a website and a mobile application.
The backend is developed using MongoDB, Express js, and node.js. 
The mobile application is developed with the Flutter framework.
The website is developed using the Vue.js framework.
